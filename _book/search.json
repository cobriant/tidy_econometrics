In this course, we’ll build on the foundation laid in EC 320 (Econometrics Part 1) and MATH 243 (Probability and Statistics). We’ll cover a range of econometric tools and techniques that can be used for data analysis with cross-sectional, time series, and panel data. We’ll also spend some time on causal inference.\nThe course will teach you how to write programs in R to solve your problems, with a focus on clarity and readability. You will learn to program in a functional, declarative style, and to think about using layers of abstraction to develop simple solutions to complicated problems."

    "text": "In this chapter, we’ll be recalling what the method of least squares is and how it works. We’ll be starting from scratch, so if EC 320 is not top of mind, don’t worry!\nI’ll refer to \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) as the estimates for the true parameters of a simple linear model: \\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + u_i\\] The hats on \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) just mean they are estimates. \\(\\beta_0\\) is the true value of the intercept: if x takes on a 0, this is the expected value for y to take on. So \\(E[y | x = 0] = \\beta_0\\), which is pronounced “the expectation of y given x takes 0 is \\(\\beta_0\\)”. And \\(\\beta_1\\) is the true effect of x on y: if x increases by one unit, \\(\\beta_1\\) is the amount by which y is expected to increase. So \\(E[y | x = \\alpha + 1] - E[y | x = \\alpha] = \\beta_1\\) for any \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n1: Introduction to OLS\n\n\n\n\n2: OLS is a method to combine observations\n\n\n\nThe method of least squares was first published by Frenchman Adrien Marie Legendre in 1805, but there is controversy about whether he was the first inventor or it was the German mathematician and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss. The method of least squares founded the study of statistics, which was then called “the combination of observations,” because that’s what least squares helps you do: combine observations to understand a true underlying process. Least squares helped to solve two huge scientific problems in the beginning of the 1800s:\n\nThere’s a field of science called Geodesy that was, at the time, concerned with measuring the circumference of the globe. They had measurements of distances between cities and angles of the stars at each of the cities, done by different observers through different procedures. But until least squares, they had no way to combine those observations.\nCeres (the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter) was discovered. “Speculation about extra-terrestrial life on other planets was open to debate, and the potential new discovery of such a close neighbour to Earth was the buzz of the scientific community,” Lim et al. (2021). Astronomers wanted to figure out the position and orbit of Ceres, but couldn’t extrapolate that with only a few noisy observations. Until least squares came along.\n\nThe method of least squares quickly became the dominant way to solve this statistical problem and remains dominant today.\nOne reason the method of least squares is so popular is that it’s so simple: the entire procedure can be summed up in one statement: the method of least squares fits a linear model that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals.\nIn the next few videos, we’ll see that for a simple regression, we can take that statement of the method of least squares and derive:\n\\[\\hat{\\beta_0} = \\bar{y} - \\beta_1 \\bar{x}\\]\n\\[\\hat{\\beta_1} = \\frac{\\sum_i x_i y_i - \\bar{x}\\bar{y}n}{\\sum_i x_i^2 - \\bar{x}^2 n}\\]\n\n3: Residuals are vertical distances: \\(e_i = y_i - \\hat{y_i}\\)\n\n\n\n\n4: OLS as \\(\\displaystyle\\min_{\\hat{\\beta_0}, \\hat{\\beta_1}} \\sum_i e_i^2 = \\min_{\\hat{\\beta_0}, \\hat{\\beta_1}} \\sum_i (y_i - \\hat{\\beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1} x_i)^2\\)\n\n\n\n\n5: \\(e_i^2 = y_i^2 - 2 \\hat{\\beta_0} y_i - 2 \\hat{\\beta_1} x_i y_i + 2 \\hat{\\beta_0} \\hat{\\beta_1} x_i + \\hat{\\beta_0}^2 + \\hat{\\beta_1}^2 x_i^2\\)\n\n\n\n\n6: Some summation rules\n\n\n\n\n7: Taking first order conditions\n\n\n\n\n8: Simplifying the FOC for \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\)\n\n\n\n\n9: Simplifying the FOC for \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\)"

    "text": "Q: “I’m not a developer. Why would I learn to program?”\nA: First, programming can make you more productive, even if you’re not a developer. You’re probably interacting with a computer the majority of your waking hours, so learning to take advantage of it more fully can be really useful.\nR is a huge step up from a tool like excel for data analytics. In R, you can write programs to clean your data, query it, visualize it, and model it. Then when you get more data, repeating all those steps for a few million more observations is as easy as a push of a button. And when someone has a question about the steps you took to do your analysis, you can just point them toward the program you wrote. In fact, it’s very common for economists to publish their data and their programs alongside their papers so that people can reproduce their work."

Don’t just guess wildly and stop googling every problem you’re stuck on. And get the hell off of stack overflow! The solutions on that site are usually written in base R, they sometimes pre-date the tidyverse, and even if they work, they won’t help your understanding. Instead, get in the habit of reading the help docs for functions. I’ve created a package called qelp (quick help) which is just beginner friendly help docs for almost all the functions you’ll need in this class. Other helpful resources are the tidyverse cheat sheets from RStudio (especially on ggplot, dplyr, and purrr), and of course office hours."

    "section": "Declarative vs Imperative Programming",
    "text": "Declarative vs Imperative Programming\nProgramming in the tidyverse may feel pretty different from your other experiences learning to program. That’s because the tidyverse is declarative, not imperative. What’s the difference? Imperative programming is relatively low-level: you think in terms of manipulating values using for loops and if statements. Declarative programming is programming at a higher abstraction level: you make use of handy functions (AKA abstractions) to manipulate large swaths of data at one time instead of going value-by-value.\nA good metaphor for the difference between imperative and declarative programming is this: suppose I’m trying to help you drive from your house to school. Imperative programming is when I send you turn-by-turn directions, and declarative programming is when I tell you to just put “University of Oregon” into your GPS. With declarative programming, I can declare what I want you to do without telling you exactly how I want you to do it like with imperative programming. Telling you to put “University of Oregon” into your GPS has advantages over giving you turn-by-turn directions: the GPS may have information about traffic and road closures that I’m not aware of. And the declarative approach is much easier for me: I could help the whole class get from their houses to the university by telling everyone to put “University of Oregon” into their GPS’s, while sending each person their own set of turn-by-turn instructions would be a lot more work.\nLikewise, when you use the tidyverse’s abstractions like filter(), mutate(), map(), reduce(), and all of ggplot2’s great plotting functions, you’re taking advantage of the fact that the engineers who built those functions know efficiency tricks in R that you may not be aware of. And when you’re programming declaratively, you can continue thinking about your problem at a high level instead of getting weighed down by nitty-gritty details. When it comes to data analysis, declarative programming has a lot of huge benefits.\nBut under the hood, all these great tidyverse functions are just a few for loops and if statements. Imperative programming certainly has its time and place, and that time and place is when your problems include implementing an algorithm by hand. If you’re interested, I highly recommend Project Euler for teaching yourself imperative programming. But imperative programming is not something you’ll need for this class. You may have mixed declarative with imperative programming in previous classes, but we’ll stay strictly in the declarative territory in this class."

We avoid this because our workflow goes like this: vectors go into tibbles and we do data analysis on tibbles. Going from tibbles to vectors (what $ lets you do) is the reverse of what we need, so we avoid it in this class. It just causes unnecessary headaches!\n\nOne more thing: I often see students using assignment <- wayyyy too much. If you’re creating a variable for something, and you only use that thing one other time, and naming that thing doesn’t help the readability of your code, why are you creating that variable? If you let your default be “no assignment” instead of “always assignment”, then your code will be much prettier and your global environment will stay clean."

    "text": "Your Approach\nWhen you’re stuck on a hard problem, here are the steps I recommend:\n\nGet crystal clear about the problem you’re trying to solve. Write out what you have versus what you want.\nBreak the problem into small steps and make a plan about how you’re going to do each step.\nNot sure about how to do a certain step? Don’t just guess wildly and stop googling every problem you’re stuck on. And get the hell off of stack overflow! The solutions on that site are usually written in base R, they sometimes pre-date the tidyverse, and even if they work, they won’t help your understanding. Instead, get in the habit of reading the help docs for functions. I’ve created a package called qelp (quick help) which is just beginner friendly help docs for almost all the functions you’ll need in this class. Other helpful resources are the tidyverse cheat sheets from RStudio (especially on ggplot, dplyr, and purrr), and of course office hours."
