# Causal Inference

What would it take to convince ourselves that $\hat{\beta_1}$ is the **causal** effect of x on y instead of just describing a correlation?

In this chapter, I'll show you the answer is exogeneity. While it's true that:

$$correlation \neq causation,$$

it's also true that:

$$correlation + exogeneity = causation.$$

## Effect of Health Insurance on Health

In the previous video, you calculated $\hat{\beta_1}$, a measure of the correlation between x and y (recall that $\hat{\beta_1} = \frac{sCov(x, y)}{sVar(x)})$.

To be sure that weâ€™ve estimated a causal effect with $\hat{\beta_1}$, we would need to observe you (with health insurance), and measure your health. Then we would need to travel back in time, changing only one thing - your decision to buy health insurance. We would then press fast forward and observe your health in this moment, without health insurance.

In summary, I can only figure out how much health insurance has effected you by seeing you in two parallel universes. In one universe, you have decided to buy health insurance. In the other universe, you have not. But we can't observe two parallel universes at once. This is the **fundamental problem of causal inference**: how much a variable truly effects a person is fundamentally unknowable because outcomes in two parallel universes can never be observed at once.

So what's the second-best thing? Instead of trying to identify an *individual* treatment effect, we may be able to identify an *average* treatment effect: the amount that a treatment or a variable x effects a larger population on average.

How? In this chapter we'll explore a couple of different possibilities. We've ruled out observing the **same person** at the **same time** with different levels of insurance because of the fundamental problem of causal inference.

Let's explore whether $\hat{\beta_1}$ has a causal interpretation in each of these scenarios:

1) The **same person** at **different times**, where sometimes they have insurance and sometimes they don't.

2) **Different people** at the **same time**, where some people have insurance and some people don't.

3) **Twins** at the **same time**, where one twin has health insurance and one twin doesn't.

## Same person at different times

I'll tackle 1) first. Suppose you have no health insurance between the ages of 26 and 30, and then you have health insurance between the ages of 30 and 34. In your late 20's your average health was a 7 and in your late 30's, your average health was a 8.5. So did having health insurance *cause* the 1.5 point increase in health? Maybe, but maybe not: what if you had no health insurance in your late 20s because you were underemployed? And because you didn't have a great job, you also found yourself anxious and depressed? But then at 30, you finally landed the job of your dreams, you got health insurance because you were employed full time, and you were much happier and healthier? So it could look like health insurance boosted your health, but in reality it was just that you tend to have health insurance at times in your life when your also have steady employment and enjoy better health because of your employment.

## Different people at the same time

For 2) different people at the same time (some insured and some not insured): Can we take the average healths of the insured, subtract the average healths of the uninsured, and consider this a causal effect? Probably not, because just like in the previous paragraph, there's *selection bias*: those who have insurance selected in, so they may be different on unobservables from those who did not. If the uninsured group is more likely to be underemployed (and perhaps more anxious and depressed), again it may look like health insurance makes people much healthier, but actually it's just the effect of steady employment.

You may be wondering: does this have anything to do with exogeneity? Of course it does: what we're really talking about here is exogeneity!

Selection bias is a type of omitted variable bias where the omitted variable is the person's propensity to get treated ("buy health insurance"). A selection bias diagram: if "propensity to be insured" correlates both with "being insured" and someone's "health", then $\hat{\beta_1}$ is biased.

 ![](images/03_image2.jpg)

Clearly, someone's propensity to be insured correlates with whether they are insured or not. Does "propensity to be insured" correlate with a person's health? Yes, through multiple channels:

- Stable employment boosts people's propensity to be insured *and* their health, as we've discussed before
- Careful, responsible people are more likely to be insured *and* they're probably healthier because they take care of themselves in other ways as well
- But these variables may be correlated in another way as well: consider a person with a chronic health condition that requires them to frequent the doctor's office or hospital. They would have a higher propensity to be insured because they know they need to visit the doctor frequently. And they also would have a lower health than a person without such a condition.

All of these are reasons why $\hat{\beta_1}$ might be biased due to selection.

## Twins at the same time

Finally, let's consider 3) "Twins at the same time, one of whom has health insurance while the other doesn't". If the twin who has health insurance has a health of 9 while the twin that doesn't has a health of 7, does that mean health insurance boosts people's healths by 2 points? No: we're still worried about selection bias. What other things are different between these twins besides the fact that one has health insurance and one doesn't? **But what if we gave out health insurance randomly to one twin, and not to the other?** That is, what if we did some kind of randomized experiment on these twins, and then observed their healths after a little while? And what if we got a bunch of twins and did the same thing? This would be one way to find the causal effect of health insurance on health because by randomizing who gets health insurance, we're enforcing exogeneity. Why?

Imagine the two twins walk in to the room and you're only told which one has health insurance and which one doesn't. Does that give you any information about which one might have steadier employment, which one might be more responsible, or which one might have a chronic health condition? No! Because we *randomized* which of the twins got the insurance. So $$E[unemployed,\ responsible,\ chronic\ condition\ |\ health\ insurance] = 0$$ in a randomized experiment, exogeneity holds and $\hat{\beta_1}$ will be an unbiased estimator of the causal effect of health insurance on health.

And actually we don't need twins after all: we just need a big group of people who we can divide randomly into a treatment and a control group. As long as the treatment and control groups look enough like each other on average, exogeneity will hold. This is why we say $correlation + exogeneity = causation$. And this is why **a randomized controlled experiment (RCT) is the gold standard for causal inference**. At the end of this course, we'll talk about a few second-best approaches for causal inference using instrumental variables and then differences-in-differences, but it's good to keep in mind that if an experiment is ethical and cost-effective, it's the best approach.

So what's the ideal experiment to find the causal effect of some variable X on some variable Y? It's an RCT where you randomize X and compare average differences in Y between treatment and control groups.

## Quantifying Selection Bias with the Rubin Causal Model

The Rubin Causal Model helps us think a little more rigorously about selection bias. Here it is:

There are two types of people: people that choose to get health insurance and people that don't. The people who choose to not get health insurance have some health level which we'll call $health_{0i}$: the 0 indicates that's their health in the universe that they are not insured.

Let's suppose health insurance has some causal effect on a person's health, and we'll call that effect $\tau_i$. Then for the types of people who choose to get health insurance, their health, $health_{1i}$ is equal to their health if they hadn't gotten insured plus the treatment effect: $health_{0i} + \tau_i$. So:

$$health_{1i} = health_{0i} + \tau_i$$

When we estimate the model:

$$health_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 insurance_i + u_i$$

$\hat{\beta_1}$ will be the average difference in the insured people's healths and the uninsured people's healths:

\begin{align*}
\hat{\beta_1} = & E[health_{1i}\ |\ type\ of\ people\ who\ get\ insured] - \\
& E[health_{0i}\ |\ type\ of\ people\ who\ don't\ get\ insured]
\end{align*}

$$$$

And since $health_{1i} = \tau_i + health_{0i}$,

\begin{align*}
\hat{\beta_1} = & E[\tau_i + health_{0i}\ |\ type\ of\ people\ who\ get\ insured] - \\
& E[health_{0i}\ |\ type\ of\ people\ who\ don't\ get\ insured]
\end{align*}

Distributing the expectation across $\tau_i + health_{0i}$ and recognizing $E[\tau_i] = \bar{\tau}$:

\begin{align*}
\hat{\beta_1} = & \bar{\tau} + E[health_{0i}\ |\ type\ of\ people\ who\ get\ insured] - \\
& E[health_{0i}\ |\ type\ of\ people\ who\ don't\ get\ insured]
\end{align*}

Then define $selection \ bias$ as:

\begin{align*}
selection \ bias = & E[health_{0i}\ |\ type\ of\ people\ who\ get\ insured] - \\
& E[health_{0i}\ |\ type\ of\ people\ who\ don't\ get\ insured]
\end{align*}

That is, **selection bias is the average difference in y for the two types of people (people who will choose x = 1 and people who will choose x = 0), insurance level held constant.** It actually doesn't matter if we hold insurance level constant at 0 or at 1: we'll get the same answer. Finally:

\begin{align*}
\hat{\beta_1} = \bar{\tau} + selection \ bias
\end{align*}
